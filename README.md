# UFOs
### Overview
For this challenge I was tasked with helping my friend Dana, a UFO researcher, develop a web app that would display a dynamic table with UFO sightings across the United states. For this app I learned how to use JavaScript to create and filter the table and I gained more knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap to display all the data in a sleek webpage.

### Results
Using the webpage is quite simple, even for a new user. First step is to load the webpage and once this is done, the user enters text in the filters on the left hand side of the table that meet their search criteria. There are five different categories and you can see what the page looks like in the picture below:

### Summary
One main drawback of this webpage design is that it will not be automatically updated with every new UFO sighting. This is unfortunate because the page looks great but it will always require maintenance to add the new sightings.

Two things I would recommend for further development would be to add web scraping capabilities to pull new data and add a button to the app so the user can have the most updated UFO information. And the second would be to include a pictures (if available) to add to the sighting list. This would probably require a lot of work but I'm sure all UFO enthusiasts would appreciate a good graphic!
